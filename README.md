Replicate the notebook (https://nipunbatra.github.io/ml-teaching/notebooks/names.html) on the next character prediction and use it for generation of text. Use one of the datasets specified below for training. Refer to Andrej Karpathyâ€™s blog post on Effectiveness of RNNs (https://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/). Visualise the embeddings using t-SNE if using more than 2 dimensions or using a scatter plot if using 2 dimensions. Write a streamlit application which asks users for an input text and it then predicts next k character
